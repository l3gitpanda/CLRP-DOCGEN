      This is the K Company Tryout document. You, as a K-Company Officer
      (KCO+), are expected to read, follow, and utilize this document
      throughout the entirety of the tryout. There are no strikes to this
      tryout however, you as the host are responsible for keeping any mingy
      and unwanted behavior out. If any signs of favoritism are shown
      throughout the course of this tryout, there will also be subsequent
      consequences to follow. Should you have any questions about how
      the tryout is to be conducted, or how to host them in general, feel free
      to direct them towards any other K Company Captain and let them
      shadow you while you host.

      "Welcome to K Company Tryouts. This tryout runs on a 2 strike system — if
      you receive 2 strikes you will fail and be dismissed. Should you fail,
      there is a 3 Hour cooldown on when you may try out again and you are
      encouraged to do so. From this point on, PTS is active for the duration
      of the tryout. Best of luck. This first phase before becoming a full
      trooper is questions, this is all open book, and I will send a link if
      you need clarification."
