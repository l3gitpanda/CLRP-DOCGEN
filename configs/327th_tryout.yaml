      Prior to conducting tryouts, there are matters that must be taken care of.
      Follow the checklist provided below to adequately set up and prepare to
      conduct tryouts:

  - type: bullet_list
    items:
      - "Find a Clone Trooper (CT) that is willing to join the 327th."
      - "You can use a tryout advert to bring attention to the 327th via /comms or /advert."
      - "Once a CT is found, bring them to a SIM room, preferably a Tryout Room, and claim it."
      - "Send a message in #327th-nco-general saying you have a recruit and @327th Star Corps Officer."

  - type: callout
    text: "/comms 327th Claims TR(number) | SIM START"
    callout_style: "info"

  - type: paragraph
    text: >
      Once all of this is done, you are then able to go over the rest of the
      tryout with them and gauge whether or not they are 327th material.
